## MVP

- The players are presented w/ 3x3 buttons
- The top of the grid informs which player turn is current
- Player X starts with the first turn
- If either player matches verticle, horizontal, or diagnal that player wins
- The game has time travel buttons when a player makes a turn and can return to that turn when clicked

## Additional Features

### (under-development)

1. For the current move only, show "You are at move #..." instead of a button ✅
2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them ✅
3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order ✅
4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw) ✅
5. Display the location for each move in the format(row,col) in the move history list
